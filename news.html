		Travel details and email addresses of around nine million easyJet customers have been accessed through a "highly sophisticated" cyber hack, according to the airline.

In a statement on Tuesday, the budget carrier said the credit card details of a further 2,208 people had been accessed, but added there was "no evidence" of the data being misused.

Passport details are not believed to have been touched.

Those who have had their data accessed will be contacted in the next few days after a "forensic" investigation uncovered the breach.

They have been advised to "continue to be alert as they would normally be", but even more so if they should receive any unsolicited communications.

It encouraged extra caution to be given to any messages received that purport to be from easyJet or easyJet holidays.
